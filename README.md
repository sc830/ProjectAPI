### Project ###
In this project, I was given a minimal set of files and tasked with integrating The Movie Database (TMDB) API into a Java application. The goal was to retrieve information about trending movies, actors, and TV shows, then categorize and display them based on specific criteria. This project provided an opportunity to delve into API integration, data manipulation, and GUI development.

### Features ###
API Integration: Implemented functionality to connect to TMDB's API and fetch data about trending movies, actors, and TV shows.
Data Sorting: Categorized and sorted the retrieved information based on different criteria, enhancing the user's ability to explore trends.
Current Information: Acquires data from TMDB on command, ensuring up-to-date information every time.

### Getting Started ###
Clone this repository to your device.
Create an account and API key for TMDB at https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs.
Create a .env file in the root directory that defines TMDB_API_KEY as your API key.
Compile and run fetch_n_print_movies.py.

### Skill Development ###
Throughout this project, I honed skills related to RESTful API usage.

API Integration: Gained hands-on experience in integrating external APIs into Java applications.
Data Manipulation: Practiced handling and manipulating JSON data obtained from API responses.

Acknowledgements
Special thanks to TMDB. This project was built upon their API, and their documentation was instrumental in its successful implementation.
